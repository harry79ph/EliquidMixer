# EliquidMixer
E liquid (also known as e-juice) is the substance inserted into an electronic cigarette which basically turns that eliquid into vapour. If you are making your own eliquid, you eventually need a specific calculator app.
And Eliquid Mixer is a basic but reliable e-liquid calculator that can be used for making DIY e liquid. All you need to do is plug in the numbers you want to mix to and it will show you the exact ratio of ingredients.
